# Cafe-Simulator-Project

CoffeeShop System
 
A simple Java-based system that simulates the operations of a cafe. Customers 
can place orders for drinks, baristas prepare and serve them, and the system 
tracks orders, menus, and daily sales. It models interactions between drinks, 
customers, baristas, and orders to replicate a functional coffee shop workflow.
